Types and Programming Languages is a book by Benjamin Pierce. It provides a good introduction to type theory and its application to programming languages.

I'm currently reading through this book. This repo contains code that I'm writing as I get through each chapter as a way for me to check my understanding of the content. Not each chapter has a "practical component" to it, but many of the chapters wrap up the previous few chapters by presenting an implementation of some concepts.
